## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap

Here's where you can go to town on how you actually built this thing. Write as much as you can here, it's totally fine if it's not too much just make sure you write *something*. If you don't have too much experience on your resume working on the front end that's totally fine. This is where you can really show off your passion and make up for that ten fold.

## Optimizations
*(optional)*

Adding server side code that can listen to client-sided devices requests and get data from users via submitting the form and after getting that data then storing it in database like MongoDB 

## Lessons Learned:

getting to know much more about Bootstrap new features and tools

## Examples:
Take a look at these couple examples that I have in my own portfolio:
